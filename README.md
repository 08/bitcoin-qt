Bitcoin ui-next integration/staging tree.

Upcoming changes to the bitcoin UI will be tested here, along with some
pull requests for the core itself if I regard them as stable enough to
be used without much risk.

Warning
=================

The history for this repository is not stable. I am rebasing, cutting,
adding and re-ordering commits all the time. This can give conflicts while
pulling. In this case, if you did not make any changes yourself, easiest is
to do a hard reset to the current origin master branch:

    git reset --hard origin/master

If you did make your own changes, be sure to use `git rebase` or `git pull
--rebase`.
